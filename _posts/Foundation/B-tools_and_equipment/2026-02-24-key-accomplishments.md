Debugging
---

Most of this project turned into an extended battle with bugs, and the emotional chaos was unreal. One minute I thought I was cruising toward a solution, and the next I was staring at a brand‑new failure like it had personally betrayed me. It drained me, stretched me, and probably shaved a few years off my lifespan — but it also forced me to grow tougher, more patient, and way more methodical than I ever expected.

Here’s a taste of the chaos:

- The Makefile staged a full rebellion. Not once. Not twice. Constantly.  
- Random notebooks decided to detach from reality and crash my terminal the moment I opened them.  
- My deployment pipeline kept sending my site to some mysterious off‑brand URL like it was lost in the multiverse.  
- The site refused to deploy with a level of stubbornness I can only describe as personal.  
- And every “fix” I celebrated lasted about five minutes before something else combusted.

I learned to accept errors, to really get my system, and most of all, I learned how to use AI. I'm not joking, AI was my hero, my knight in shining armor, my prince that battled the dragon. Copilot was helpful, once it got to know my system, it couldnt help me fix everything, just the parts that were on the surface. For the deeper parts. I needed to bring out the big guns: My Father...


Eventually, I stopped treating the errors like enemies and started treating them like clues. With Copilot helping me decode the nonsense, I learned to follow the trail backward — layer by layer — until the real issue finally revealed itself. It wasn’t glamorous, but it worked.

And when everything finally clicked into place? I felt like I was Harry Potter and had finally defeated the one who shall not be named. I felt like Percy Jackson, or Katniss Everdeen after shooting Coin and not Snow (IYKYK)

Starting Over
---

In my opinion, the most important thing I learned was that starting over is scary, but I was never starting from scratch.

Sure, even if my github had 16 repos called Portfolio followed by the number it was in line and even if my friends were really good at debugging and fixing random issues, I was okay with starting over because I was armed with the knowledge I had from my failiures.

As my wise friend once asked me "why don't you just fix the error?" I didn't have a reply at the time, but now I do: I can fix the error, sure, but what's better than that? Figuring out what went wrong in the first place. 

Let me tell you the story of making my About Me Page (Linked somewhere in this blog) It took me forever, I had never used any of these tools before, I didn't know how to use images, I didn't even know how to open my local host. the biggest problem was that when I committed my work, nothing would show up on my github link. I panicked, I totally freaked out. I turned to youtube videos and copilot, both of which failed. Then I decided to make another student repository. TADA! Apparently, I had gone to the config,yml file and typed in Stubent instead of Student. When I re-did it on a new repository, I didn't have to spend 3 hours finding my error, I could just do it over. 

That's the amazing thing about Computer Science and code, you can somehow click undo, or get a fresh start. and that's and oppurtunity, that doesn't come often.

My Work

300 million years of coding later...

But seriously, I wished I took more screenshots at the moment! 

You will never imagine the absolute delight and happiness I felt when I clicked on my repo link and saw my About me Page. 

A simple task when I think back on it now. But it was my first project, and I feel like I had conquered the world like Alexander the Great when I saw my work come to life.

MY ABOUT ME PAGE IS LINKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE, IN LIGHT BLUE!!

My Work Continued: Mathematical Expressions
---

Another project that I am very proud of is my group team teach lesson. We chose mathematical expressions as our topic. 

On this specific project I really liked it because of the presentation part. I love presenting things and talking to a large group of people because I have a lot of practice from doing it at seminars and hindu school from when I was younger. My parents always pushed me to be confident, so I have them to thank more than anyone.

I liked working with my team. I liked to see the other teams. and I liked to assign and grade homework! 

Maybe you can give a try at my lesson! 

MY LESSON IS LINKED DOWN BELOW IN RED! PLEASE GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A TRY!

Summary
---
This blog was pretty short, but I tried making it entertaining!

Hopefully I'll have a million more things to add and this blog will be as long as the Harry Potter series, but maybe not and this is the last you've seen of me...

Anyway! Good Bye and Good Luck

Please reach out to me on slack for any help with your coding endeavors.
